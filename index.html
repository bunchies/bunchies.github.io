    5 apples, a shoe, and cheese. <a href="http://forum.bunchies.org/"><b>The Moon Base</b></a> is a series of forums with a history dating back to April 3, 2005 with the <a href="http://z6.invisionfree.com/quickarcade/index.php?showtopic=919">very first thread in the very first moon base</a>. On September 28, 2005, it evolved into its own community of friends dedicated to silliness on the web. Now it aims to be a forum for testing and developing forum features and themes.

        ip6 is also available at <a href="irc://irc6.rizon.net/bunchies">#bunchies @ Rizon (IP6)</a><br/>

        I highly recommend <a href="http://wiki.rizon.net/index.php?title=Nick_Registration">registering your username</a> when you connect; this will enable you to register your own channel if you want and get channel benefits (and the channel may be set to registered users only if necessary). There's a bunch of cool stuff you can do with NickServ too, such as a custom vhost.
