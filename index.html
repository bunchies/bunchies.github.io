    ip6 is also available at <a href="irc://irc6.rizon.net/bunchies">#bunchies @ Rizon-IP6</a><br/>
    More information about the server, including a web interface to connect is available at <a href="http://rizon.net/">Rizon.net</a><br/><br/>
    I highly recommend <a href="http://wiki.rizon.net/index.php?title=Nick_Registration">registering your username</a> when you connect; this will enable you to register your own channel if you want and get channel benefits (and the channel may be set to registered users only if necessary). There's a bunch of cool stuff you can do with NickServ too, such as a custom vhost.<br/><br/>
    Be sure to check out the <a href="http://wiki.rizon.net/">Rizon wiki</a> for help with various commands relating to IRC.<br/><br/>
    <b>Rules:</b> Don't really have set rules, basically just don't be a jerk, listen to the ops, don't be illegal, stuff like that- the basic common sense netiqette that you'll find in most places. No racism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, and stuff like that too. Rules may be updated and modified at any time.<br/>
